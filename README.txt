This is the Hello World deliverable for PLT group josh.
Members: Angel Garcia, Burcu Cetin, Bora Elci, Gregory Schare, Vasileios
Benopoulos.

Our deliverable includes An example test file (point.josh) as well as a 
scanner, a parser, ast, sast and semantics checker.
The final three were largely based off of the Micro C code shown in class.
